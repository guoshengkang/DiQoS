 Thank you for your interest in downloading the Quality of Web Service (QWS) 
 Dataset. This dataset includes quality, ranking, and classification metrics 
 for 2507 real Web services. The information contained on the attached zip 
 is believed to be accurate. Some of the services  may have changed since our 
 last crawl for creating this dataset. For description of how these attributes 
 were measured, please go to: https://qwsdata.github.io

 For simplicity, the dataset file is a plain text file that contains multiple 
 rows. Each row consists of information related to a particular Web service and 
 includes the name and Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) address. The Web 
 services chosen from our repository were carefully selected to cover as many 
 domains and service functionalities.
